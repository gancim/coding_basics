# Object Oriented Programming

Objects that interact with each other classes generate object and define their structure (data and methods)

## Abstraction
Hide internal details and describe things in simple terms.
Achievable with encapsulation and inheritance.

## Encapsulation (set/get)
Technique used to implement abstraction.
Different accesses restriction to class and methods.

## Polymorphism (aka Interface)
Object behaves differently in different situations.
1) Compile time polymorphism -> method overloading
2) Method polymorphism -> superclass/subclass method used only at Runtime

## Inheritance (aka Subclass/Superclass)
Object is based on another object (code reuse).

## Association
Relationship between object - multiplicity between Objects.

## Aggregation
Special type of association -> relationship and ownership between Objects.

## Compositions
Special case of aggregation -> relationship and can't exist on it's own (i.e. room - house).
