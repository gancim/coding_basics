# Combinatorics
Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics which is about counting.

Factorials (3 chairs 3 students): is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
For example: `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`

Permutations (2 chairs 2 students): act of arranging all the members of a set into some sequence or order.
`nPm = n! / (n-m)!`

Combinations: permutations are used when you select objects and care about their order. However in some problems you donâ€™t care about the order and just want to know how many ways there are to select a certain number of objects from a bigger set.
`nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!`

# Elementary probability
It defines what is more or less probable and by what amount.

`Probability of an event E = Number of outcomes favorable to E / Total number of outcomes`

# Algebra
Letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.

`4x - 2 = 5`

where:

- `4` is a coefficient
- `x` is a variable
- `-` is an operator
- `2`,`5` are constants

## Order of operations

BODMAS:
- B: Brackets first
- O: Orders (powers & square roots)
- DM: Division & Multiplication
- AS: Addition & Subtraction

## Equations

`x + 2 = 6` this equal that

## Exponent

`8^2`

where:

- `8` is base
- `2` is exponent

Basic rules:

- `x^-n = 1 / x^n`
- `x^0 = 1`
- `x^1 = x`
- `x^n * x^m = x^(n+m)`

## Formula

`v = lwh`

where

- v is the subject
